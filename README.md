Hey Melissa, so, I was thinking about making a kind of basic black jack simulator that would have the user play against the computer. Besides the basic gameplay, the program would also calculate probabilities of busting for both players and give recommendations based around some threshold. Any suggestions or ways to incorporate other lessons?
